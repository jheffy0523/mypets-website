<h1>MY FOUR LEGGED BUDDIES</h1>
<p>Life can be a stressful enviroment and having something to look up to when arriving home can be exciting and fun. For over many years since I can remember I always had a dog that has kept me company whether is on my good or bad days and looking back at all the time I have spend with them, I have come to realise that they are what keeps me at a healthy daily life. I hd, have, and always will had a four legged buddy to keep me company when I need them the most.</p>
